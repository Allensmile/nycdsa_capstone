    "\n",
    "A hash table is a collection of items which are stored in such a way as to make it easy to find them later. Each position of the hash table, can hold an item and is named by an integer value starting at 0. Initially, the hash table contains no items so every slot is empty. We can implement a hash table by using a list with each element initialized to the special Python value None.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/hashtable.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The mapping between an item and the slot where that item belongs in the hash table is called the **hash function**. The hash function will take any item in the collection and return an integer in the range of slot names, between 0 and m-1. The simplest hash function, sometimes referred to as the “remainder method”, takes an item and divides it by the table size, returning the remainder as its hash value.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/hashtable2.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the hash function, two or more items may be in the same slot. This is referred to as a **collision**. Clearly, collisions create a problem for the hashing technique. \n",
    "\n",
    "When two items hash to the same slot, we must have a systematic method for placing the second item in the hash table. This process is called **collision resolution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "One method for resolving collisions looks into the hash table and tries to find another open slot to hold the item that caused the collision. A simple way to do this is to start at the original hash value position and then move in a sequential manner through the slots until we encounter the first slot that is empty. Note that we may need to go back to the first slot (circularly) to cover the entire hash table. By systematically visiting each slot one at a time, we are performing an open addressing technique called **linear probing**.\n",

    "### Implementing the HashMap Data Type (aka Python dict)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most useful Python collections is the dictionary. Recall that a dictionary is an associative data type where you can store key–data pairs. The key is used to look up the associated data value. We often refer to this idea as a map.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `map` data type is defined as follows:\n",
    "* The structure is an unordered collection of associations between a key and a data value. \n",
    "* The keys in a map are all unique so that there is a one-to-one relationship between a key and a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, such a data structure usually refers `HashMap`, which means to use hash function to map a key to a corresponding value. In addition to storing key-value pairs, the `HashMap` class should also have the following features:\n",
    "* O(1) inserting time and O(1) searching time\n",
    "* Automatically resizing based on the total number of key-value pairs to save space\n",
